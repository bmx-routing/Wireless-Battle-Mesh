# Wireless-Meshup
"Mesh is in the air" - this year mesh up of the "Wireless Battle of the Mesh (WBMv11)" and "Wireless Community Weekend (WCW18)" at Berlin C-Base from 7. - 13. May 2018

[BMX-routing] project endorses _"Mesh is in the air"_ - this year mesh up of the __"Wireless Battle of the Mesh (WBMv11)"__ and *"Wireless Community Weekend (WCW18)"*.

We keep the approach to test the performance of different routing protocols for ad-hoc networks and combine it with the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the yearly Freifunk community get together. The mix becomes a global gathering of wifi tech experts, mesh developers and community networkers that join the event to hack, test, discuss, explain, learn and barbecue at [c-base], Berlins famous hacker-space-station.

If you are a mesh networking enthusiast, community activist, have an interest in wifi or dynamic routing protocols, you can't miss this event! 
So check out our continuously updated information about the event at [Wireless Meshup]

The [BattleMesh] is free of charge and open for all, every year we strive to keep participation costs low by negotiating deals for accommodation and food. 

This year the event will take place from Monday 7th to Sunday 13th of May, 2018 in Berlin, Germany. The event is locally organized by [Freifunk], Germany's community wireless network. 

We endorse and support "Mesh is in the air" not only for the efforts made by its community to advance the field of wireless mesh networking and foster the development of grass-roots community networks, but for their contribution to digital freedom rights movement, humanitarian aid, empowerment of peoples tech/net/media competency and a free and open civil society.

BMX-routing team will support the event by: 
* Promoting the event 
* Inviting and hosting community activists during the event 
* Presenting overview and insight on BMX7 advances, deployments, and experiences 
* Introduce ongoing and upcoming projects 
* Contribute to experimentation with hardware, test configuration and analysis
